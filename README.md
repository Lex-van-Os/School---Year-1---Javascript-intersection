"# School---Year-1---Javascript-intersection" 

This project was the last part of the javascript period of my first year of my education. The project simulates an intersection.

Most of the HTML files are files of the intersection during the development, some might be more "incomplete" than others. For the full version, "Kruising compleet" should be opened. The image files are included in "verkeer"
